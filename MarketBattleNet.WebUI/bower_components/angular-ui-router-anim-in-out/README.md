# angular-ui-router-anim-in-out

An animation directive to use with ngAnimate 1.2+ and ui-router


## Installation

```
$ bower install angular-ui-router-anim-in-out --save
```
or
```
$ npm i -D angular-ui-router-anim-in-out
```


## Quick Start

* Include `anim-in-out.js` & `anim-in-out.css` on the page
* Include module as a dependency of your app

```js
angular.module('ExampleApp', ['ngAnimate', 'ui.router', 'anim-in-out'])
```

* Configure states as per [ui-router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router) instructions
* Add the animation directive `anim-in-out` to your `ui-view` elements by applying the class `anim-in-out`

```html
<div ui-view="mainView" class="anim-in-out"></div>
```

* Finally add classes from the `anim-in-out.css` to any elements you wish to transition on state change eg. `anim-fade`, `anim-slide-left`

```html
<div ui-view="mainView" class="anim-in-out anim-fade" data-anim-speed="1000">

    <!-- Dynamically loaded view content -->
    
    <div class="my-component anim-slide-left"></div>

</div>
```

**Note: you must use absolute positioning of `ui-view` elements**

## Usage

Animations are triggered by javascript in order to provide events.

```js
// In your main controller
$rootScope.$on('animStart', function($event, element, speed) {
    // do something
});
    
$rootScope.$on('animEnd', function($event, element, speed) {
    // do something
});
```

The default transition speed is `1000ms` this can be altered using the `data-anim-speed` attribute on the `ui-view`. This is optionally further customised by the `data-anim-in-speed` and `data-anim-out-speed` attributes.

By default the animation of the incoming state will be triggered after a delay (`data-anim-speed` / `data-anim-in-speed`), but this can be changed by setting the attribute `data-anim-sync` to `true`.

```html
<div ui-view="mainView" class="anim-in-out" data-anim-sync="true"></div>
```

## FAQs

#### Why is the position of my views all messed up? Or why are both views visible during the transition?
This directive works as a supplement to `ui-router` and `ngAnimate`. The way these two libraries handle transitions is to add both incoming and outgoing views to the dom as sibling nodes, then add/remove the classes required to produce the transition effect. As the view elements exist in parallel in the dom you are required to use absolute positioning to counter the problem of one view effecting the others position.

## Gotchas

If you notice a difference in behaviour after compiling your app such as an initial transition failing to trigger the suggestion in this [comment](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/5130#issuecomment-34371140)/[plunkr](http://plnkr.co/edit/aoyRehXQnItGYA0EzTOC?p=preview) may help you, or see below:.

```js
angular
    .module('app', ['ngAnimate'])
    .controller('MainCtrl', function ($scope, $timeout, $rootElement) {
        // Monkey-patch for ngAnimate to force animations to be played right
        // on the first digest. A "run-time revert" of this commit:
        // https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/eed2333298412fbad04eda97ded3487c845b9eb9
        // Note: dirty hack! Do not use in production code unless you accept
        // all consequences!
        $rootElement.data("$$ngAnimateState").running = false;
    });
```
